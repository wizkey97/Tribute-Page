              Anonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist group that
              is widely known for its various DDoS cyber attacks against several
              governments, government institutions and government agencies,
              corporations, and the Church of Scientology. Anonymous originated
              in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many
              online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an
              anarchic, digitized global brain. Anonymous members (known as
              Anons) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of

              in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for
              Vendetta. However, this may not always be the case as some of the
              collective prefer to instead cover their face without using the
              well-known mask as a disguise. Some anons also opt to mask their
              voices through voice changers or text-to-speech programs. In its
              early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online
              community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually
              toward a loosely self-agreed goal and primarily focused on
              entertainment (or lulz). Beginning with Project Chanology in
              2008—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church
              of Scientology—the Anonymous collective became increasingly
              associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues
              internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with
              Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct
              action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by
              motion picture and recording industry trade associations.

              Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies
              of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic
              State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright
              protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations
              such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly
              supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement. Related groups
              LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S.
              government agencies, media, video game companies, military
              contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in
              the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. Some
              actions by members of the group have been described as being
              anti-Zionist[citation needed]. Dozens of people have been arrested
              for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including
              the U.S., U.K., Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, India, and
              Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary
              widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters" and
              digital Robin Hoods while critics have described them as "a cyber
              lynch-mob" or "cyber terrorists". In 2012, Time called Anonymous
              one of the "100 most influential people" in the world.
